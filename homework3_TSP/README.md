### Travelling Salesman Problem

_TSP is another very hard problem (NP-complete problem), whose exact solution is infeasible when the number of cities is large_

- The presented genetic algorithm is a local optimization technique, which finds good approximate solutions to the problem in reasonable time.

**Remark**: the number of individuals in the population should be an _even number_
