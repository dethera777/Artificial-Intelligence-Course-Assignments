## Artifical Intelligence course at Sofia University (Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics) - winter semester 2020/2021

### For the course we had 8 assignments (mini-projects):

1. **Sliding puzzle** using the \*IDA\** algorithm and the *Manhattan distance heuristic\*
2. **N-Queens** using the _MinConflicts_ (_Random Restart Hill climbing_) algorithm
3. **Travelling Salesman Problem** using a _genetic_ algorithm
4. **Tic-Tac-Toe** using the _Minimax_ algorithm with _alpha-beta pruning_
5. **Naive Bayes Classifier**
6. **Decision Tree Classifier** built with the _ID3_ (_Top-Down Induction of Decision Trees_) algorithm
7. **K-Means** and **K-Means++** clustering algorithms
8. Simple **Feed-Forward Neural Network** for AND, OR and XOR logic gates
