### Sliding Puzzle

**_Not every input configuration is solvable_**

**Remark 1**: the input to the program should be a solvable configuration

**Remark 2**: the problem is pretty hard (NP-hard actually), so for hard 15-puzzle and 24-puzzle configurations the program will run for too long (much longer than you would be willing to wait)
